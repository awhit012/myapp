<h3 class= "heading">About Alex White</h3>
<p>Hello. I made this website using Ruby on Rails. I am passionate about technology, the internet, and how these things will change our lives, particularly in the areas of finance, collaborative culture, and sustainability. I have a degree in Cultural Anthropology from UCSB. I do stand up comedy, I teach kids how to build robots, and I can breath fire. I used to be a chef. I am curious above all else and live my life by following my curiosity. It has lead me to computer science and web application design and I love it.</p>
